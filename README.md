# Fire-Reporting-System
# Description

Welcome to the Fire Reporting System! This system is built using the Django web framework and allows users to report fires in their area. Users can submit a report including the location of the fire, its size, and any additional notes. The reports are then stored in a database and can be viewed by authorized personnel. Admins can also view, update, and delete reports. This system can be easily integrated into any existing website and is a great tool for quickly reporting and tracking fires in real-time.
